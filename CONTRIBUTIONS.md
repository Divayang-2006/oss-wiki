## ‚öôÔ∏è Repository setup & installation

Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime
- A GitHub account

Setup steps

```powershell
# clone your fork (replace <your-username>)
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/oss-wiki.git
cd oss-wiki

# add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Grenish/oss-wiki.git
```

Install dependencies (preferred: Bun)

```powershell
# using Bun (recommended)
bun install

# or npm
npm install

# or yarn
yarn install
```

Start development server

```powershell
bun dev
# or: npm run dev
# or: yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to confirm the site runs locally.

Quick verification

- Browse `/content/docs` pages
- Make a small change (e.g. edit a doc) to confirm hot reload
- Check console for build/runtime errors

---

## üå≥ Branching & commit conventions

Branching

- Create a branch per change from `main` (or `dev` if instructed):
  - `feat/<short-description>`
  - `fix/<short-description>`
  - `docs/<short-description>`
  - `refactor/<short-description>`

Commit messages

- Use Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>`
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`

Examples

```powershell
git commit -m "feat(docs): add contributing guide"
git commit -m "fix(search): fix pagination bug"
```

Keeping your fork up-to-date

```powershell
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

## üõ† Development workflow & making changes

1. Sync with upstream `main` and create a branch.
2. Make focused, small changes. Prefer multiple small PRs over one large PR.
3. Update or add tests where appropriate.
4. Run the dev server and lint/build steps before committing.

Useful commands

```powershell
# start dev server
bun dev

# build to ensure production build works
bun run build

# lint (if configured)
bun run lint
```

Project structure guidance

- Content: `/content/docs` (MDX files)
- Components/UI: `/components` and `/components/ui`
- App entry and routes: `/app`
- Utilities & libs: `/lib`

---

## üîç Code review process & expectations

Submitting a PR

- Push your branch to your fork and open a PR against `main` (or `dev` if requested).
- Fill out the PR description with what changed, why, and any manual test steps.
- Link related issues using `Closes #<issue-number>` when appropriate.

Review lifecycle

- CI will run (build, lint, tests) ‚Äî ensure these pass.
- Maintainers/reviewers will request changes or approve.
- Address feedback promptly and keep the PR up-to-date.

Reviewer expectations

- Provide constructive, specific feedback
- Prefer small incremental suggestions
- Run the branch locally if needed for UI changes

Merging

- Maintainers merge PRs after approvals and passing CI.
- Squash merge is preferred to keep history tidy unless otherwise requested.

## üêû Issues and templates overview

Before opening an issue

- Search existing issues and discussions to avoid duplicates.
- Confirm the issue persists on the latest `main`.

Filing a bug report

Include:
- Title: concise summary
- Description: what happened
- Steps to reproduce: exact steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment: browser, OS, Node/Bun version
- Attach logs/screenshots if helpful

Feature requests

Include:
- Problem statement
- Proposed solution or examples
- Alternatives considered

Templates

- Use the provided GitHub issue templates (Bug report / Feature request) when opening a new issue.
